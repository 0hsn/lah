# `lah`
command line application that can be used alternative to `ls -lah`

### Purpose

We already have `ls` which is builtin command for almost all *nix I used. This standard tools is also used for many automation. The purpose of this project is not to replace the tool. This tool exist to complement `ls -lah` use case. I expect this command line tools will help linux noobs to understand and grasp different columns and their values used in `ls -lah`.
